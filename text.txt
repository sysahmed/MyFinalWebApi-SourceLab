Design a Relational Database with tables for Orders, Order lines, Items and Clients. As minimum, the
data structure must support:
 Orders: number, date, client, grand total amount
 Order lines: number, item, unit price, quantity, total price
 Items: name, description, unit price
 Clients: name, address
Develop a Web API which supports:
 Insert an order
 Update an order
 Delete an order
 Get all orders per client
 Get all orders for a date
Develop an Azure Function picks up the messages from a message queue (of your choice). Each message
contains information necessary to create a new order. The function must store each message in a log
(Azure table, partitioned by month) and call the API to store the order in the relational database. Design
and implement behavior in case the API call doesn’t succeed.
